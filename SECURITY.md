- **Subject**: [SECURITY] Brief description of the vulnerability

### 📋 Include in Your Report
Please include the following information:
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Environment**: Hardware, software versions, and configuration
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable (be responsible)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for mitigation

### 🕐 Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available

### 🏆 Recognition
We appreciate security researchers and will:
- Acknowledge your contribution (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- Provide credit in release notes and security advisories
- Consider responsible disclosure bounties for significant findings
